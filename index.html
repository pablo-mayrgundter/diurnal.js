    <p>Diurnal is a small utility to switch stylesheets for bright and
      dark settings.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Bright</strong> <button class="diurnal-control diurnal-bright">☼</button>
        <p>If you're coding by the pool, remember to keep your laptop
           dry.  But also, it's gonna be hard to see the screen with a
           dark background and light text.
          <p><em>Switch to bright mode and enjoy the Sun!</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dark</strong> <button class="diurnal-control diurnal-dark">☼</button>
        <p>If you're up late, stuck on a coding binge or lost in
           dependency hell, be sure to mind your vision with a
           brighter screen (yes, it helps you focus), but no so bright
           it gives you a headache.
        <p><em>Switch to dark mode and chill into the night.</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Browser Compatibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Chrome 88/Brave 1.19 - looks great</li>
      <li>Safari 13.1 - looks good, sun symbol in controls is slightly smaller and lower than Chrome</li>
      <li>Firefox 84 - looks fine, sun symbol slightly smaller still</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Patches to normalize cross browser appreciated!
