# diurnal.js

[Live Demo Here](https://pablo-mayrgundter.github.io/diurnal.js/)

Diurnal is a small utility to switch stylesheets for bright and dark settings.

- **Bright** ☀

If you're coding by the pool, remember to keep your laptop dry.  But
also, it's gonna be hard to see the screen with a dark background and
light text.

*Switch to bright mode and enjoy the Sun!*

- **Dark** ☼

If you're up late, stuck on a coding binge or lost in dependency hell,
be sure to mind your vision with a brighter screen (yes, it helps you
focus), but no so bright it gives you a headache.

*Switch to dark mode and chill into the night.*

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 88/Brave 1.19 - looks great
- Safari 13.1 - looks good, sun symbol in controls is slightly smaller and lower than Chrome
- Firefox 84 - looks fine, sun symbol slightly smaller still

Patches to normalize cross browser appreciated!
